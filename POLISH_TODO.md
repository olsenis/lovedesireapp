## Entertainment roadmap — pending

### #9 Calendar reposition — ✅ shipped (fa7c365) + Countdowns merged (next commit)
**Status:** Shipped as ledger; Countdowns duplicate feature merged into Special Days
**Follow-up:** Ported the secret-date toggle from Countdowns → Special Days modal, deleted `app/countdown.tsx`, updated 4 Home nudge routes + 1 Profile row from `/countdown` to `/calendar`.
---
**Original notes below (kept for history):**
**File:** `app/calendar.tsx` (screen title already renamed to "Special Days" but screen is still a calendar grid)
**Change:**
- **Remove** the month grid (7-column day-cell layout + prev/next month arrows + weekday header + dot indicators)
- **Keep + expand** the "Upcoming" section as the primary content
- **Restructure** into a pure ledger: chronological list of all special days grouped by "This month" / "Next 3 months" / "Later" — or a single flat list with each entry showing `emoji · label · date · in N days`
- **Include auto-dates** (Valentine's, partner birthday) inline in the ledger, not just hidden as calendar dots
- **Add "+ Add" button** to the header (like other list screens with add functionality) — no longer tap-a-day-to-add
- **Empty state:** keep the ledger copy ("Nothing on the ledger yet. Tap + Add for anniversaries, birthdays, or first-times worth remembering.")
- **Delete/edit:** preserve existing swipe-to-delete or × affordance per row
**Why:** Users already have Google/Apple Calendar. Duplicating a month grid signals "we're a mediocre calendar". A pure ledger signals "we hold the dates that matter, not every meeting". Rating goal: 5.2 → 6.4 per review.
**Caveats:**
- The auto-date system currently only inlines Valentine's + partner birthday. Consider whether to include anniversary from `couple.startDate` too — probably yes.
- If we want to allow scrolling forward through future years' entries, the sort needs to handle the year-rollover logic that the current Upcoming section already does (moves past dates to next year).

### #10 /upgrade copy reorder — ✅ shipped (801ed02, previous session)
**Status:** Shipped
**Notes:** FEATURES array already leads with Fantasy Wishes + Sensate + Fire & Desire per the review. Was landed in an earlier session (Aug 2026) but the roadmap doc wasn't updated. No further work needed — the file's own comment (lines 8-13) documents the ordering rationale.
---
**Original notes below (kept for history):**
**File:** `app/upgrade.tsx`
**Change:**
- Reorder the FEATURES array so **Fantasy Wishes**, **Sensate Focus**, and **Fire + Desire challenge programs** are the top three items
- Blueprint (The Lovers) and adult moods (kinky/horny) drop to secondary
- Copy tweaks per item — lead with benefit / experience, not mechanic
**Why:** FW + Sensate + Fire are the most flagship-worthy premium features. The upgrade screen should sell those first, not "5-type intimacy quiz".
**Caveats:** Order shift may need a corresponding icon/color tweak per feature card so the top three still feel balanced.

### #5 Journal redesign — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/journal.tsx` + new `constants/journalPrompts.ts` + new `services/journalPromptsService.ts`
**Change:**
- **Rotating prompts** — 25 curated reflective prompts, one per (week × couple) via deterministic seed (same helpers pattern as Love Language nudge). Rose-tinted prompt card at top of Journal screen. "Reflect on it →" opens compose modal with prompt as placeholder text.
- **Weekly retrospective** — Sunday-only card between prompt and entries. Shows my count + partner count + dominant journal moods + partner's mood-log emojis side-by-side. Disposable — appears Sunday, vanishes Monday.
- **Streak-lite** — small `🔥 N-day streak` pill in the header when streak ≥ 3. Client-derived from the entry stream (no Firestore writes, no schema change). Breaks silently on missed day — no shame, no punishment.
**Deferred:** no Home nudge (Journal is low-frequency; adding it would compete with actual waiting-for-you signals). No push notification. No per-prompt storage on entries. No prompt customization. No retro archive.

### #7 Intimacy Log narrative — Phase 1 ✅ shipped (next commit); Phase 2+3 deferred
**File:** `services/intimacyService.ts` + `app/intimacy-tracker.tsx` + `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Change:** Pure client-side monthly narrative surface + Home discoverability nudge.
- New helpers: `generateMonthlyNarrative(entries, monthDate)`, `computeMonthlyDelta(entries, monthDate)`, `previousMonthDate()`
- New NarrativeCard at top of Stats tab, past-month only (≥3 entries threshold), rose-stripe blush card. 2-4 warm sentences + Pulse-style delta pill (up/down/flat) + optional reflection prompt when Disconnected entries exist.
- New Home nudge: days 1-7 of new month, prev-month ≥3 entries → `✨ Your {month} in intimacy · N moments · read the story →` routing to `/intimacy-tracker?tab=stats`
- Deep-link `?tab=stats` support added to intimacy-tracker mount
**Deferred (Phase 2):** ties to Sensate + Daily via one-tap "want to log this?" prompts on stage completion / spicy pick vote. Requires suppressing `notifyPartner` side-effect for auto-logged entries.
**Deferred (Phase 3):** anonymised cross-couple benchmark ("couples in year 3 log an average of 6/month"). Requires scheduled Cloud Function writing anonymised aggregates + opt-in settings toggle + Privacy Policy addendum.

### Deferred
- **#2 Emotional Weather** — needs historical data before it can pattern-match. Revisit post-launch.
- **#4b Versus starter pool** — cold-start fix. Revisit if user reports post-launch.

## Home screen polish (from Aug 2026 Home audit)

Ordered roughly by impact / effort ratio (best first).

### H1 Personalize greeting — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Change:** `getGreeting()` now accepts an optional `name` arg and returns `${base}, ${firstName}` when profile.name is set. Falls back to bare greeting during onboarding.
**Why:** Warmest possible first impression, cheapest possible fix.

### H2 Sunday Love-Language Home card — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` nudge system
**Change:** New nudge branch that unshifts on Sundays when partner has a `loveLanguage`. Also hides the daily insight card on Sundays (same-theme collision — Sunday nudge owns the LL surface).
**Deferred:** per-Sunday dismissal after tap. Card stays visible all Sunday for now — if that turns out annoying, easy to add `ll_sunday_seen_week` AsyncStorage flag using the same pattern as the insight card's `insight_dismissed_date`.

### H3 Deduplicate Fantasy Wishes nudges — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` nudge branches
**Change:** Partner-ahead FW nudge now suppressed when the matches nudge fires (both route to same screen, both use ✨). Matches wins because it's the higher-value specific-reward signal.

### H4 Fix Insight eyebrow label — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` insight card render
**Change:** Imported `LOVE_LANGUAGE_LABELS`, mapped raw key → human label, dropped "FOR YOU" for a tighter eyebrow: `INSIGHT · WORDS OF AFFIRMATION`.

### H5 Async Dares launcher tile — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` Tonight's Picks section
**Change:** Added 4th tile between Fantasy Wishes and "See all games" row: `🎁 Dares · Send a challenge, watch it get done` → `/dares`.

### H6 Fold "partner suggested" nudge into Together List row — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Change:** The Together List row already surfaces `N suggestions waiting · N open` in its subtitle when partner has pending suggestions. The parallel Waiting-for-you nudge was pure duplicate — removed. Row keeps doing the work.

### H7 Semantic nudge palette (1-2h)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` + `constants/colors.ts` (add tokens)
**Change:** Currently nudge card backgrounds are 6 hardcoded pastel hex values (`#FFF9C4`, `#FFF3E0`, `#F3E5F5`, `#FAEEF2`, `#FFF0F3`, `#FFF4E8`) chosen ad-hoc. Move to a semantic system:
- **Urgent** (waiting for me, expiring): blush (`Colors.blush`)
- **Informational** (partner activity, ambient): cream (`Colors.white` or muted cream)
- **Celebratory** (matches, milestones): warm amber, once — not per row
Also rehabilitate On-this-day + Insight into the token palette (they're currently amber/tan outside the design system).
**Why:** Rainbow-stack effect — no semantic meaning behind colour differences. Palette tokens would make the stack readable at a glance.

### H8 Priority sort + cap the nudge stack (1-2h)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` nudge memo
**Change:** Add priority weights per nudge type. Sort descending. Cap at 4-5 visible with a "See N more" affordance if more exist.
- Priority tiers: incoming actions (P1) > partner-ahead (P2) > time-based (P3) > LDR ambient (P4)
**Why:** LDR + Sunday power-user can see 8+ nudges. Priority + cap keeps Home actionable, not overwhelming.

### H9 Polish Tonight's Picks copy — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` Tonight's Picks tiles
**Change:** Daily / T-or-D / Fantasy Wishes subtitles rewritten benefit-first per the plan. Dares already benefit-first from H5. Lock badge appended after new copy for free-tier Fantasy Wishes.

### H10 Reserve emoji per surface — ✅ shipped (next commit)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` nudge branches
**Change:**
- LDR Care Package 🎁 → 📦 (literal package, no collision with Async Dares)
- Year in Review ✨ → 🎊 (year-end feel, distinctive from ambient FW/LDR ✨)
- LDR pre-visit day 4 (tease) 📸 → 🔥 (matches "teaser of what's coming" subtitle)
- LDR pre-visit day 6 (surprise) 🎁 → 🌟 (something special, no gift-emoji collision)
- Together List suggested ✨ removed via H6 (no longer competes)
Remaining shared ✨: FW matches + FW partner-ahead (mutually exclusive via H3 dedupe), LDR post-visit day 1, LDR pre-visit day 2, monthly narrative — these fire in different scenarios, rare same-Home collision. Acceptable.
Remaining shared 📸: Moments daily prompt + incoming Flash — both photo-related, rare same-Home collision. Acceptable.

### H11 Prune unused styles (~10 min)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` StyleSheet
**Change:** Remove dead styles: `ritualRow`, `dailyWishCard`, `moodSummaryCard`, `sparkBtn`, `flashBtn`, `name`, `moodSelected*`, `partnerMoodRow`, `sectionHeader`, `changeText`.
**Why:** Housekeeping. No behaviour change; cleaner file.

### H12 Warmer inactive-partner state (optional, ~30 min)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` couple card
**Change:** When partner has never opened the app (no `lastActive`, no mood, avatar shows `?`), add a subtle line under partner avatar: "Waiting for Ola to open Desire ✨" + a "Nudge them" button that sends a friendly reminder push.
**Why:** Half-populated Home looks broken. Explain why + give the user an action.
